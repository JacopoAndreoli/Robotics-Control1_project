# Robotics-Control1_project
Evaluation of control schemes regarding robotics manipulator seen during lessons; understading the trade-offs between complexity and tracking accuracy and appropriately gain tuning. Identification of stability issues that could arise in case of singularity conditions or ill-posed initial coonditions
